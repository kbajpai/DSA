% the abstract

This is a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course with a strong focus on passing coding interviews for software engineering jobs. This course takes a very pragmatic approach to teaching DSA. The course is primarily taught through examples - it includes \textbf{hundreds} of carefully curated problems that show up in actual interviews. These examples are delivered through a balanced mix of walkthroughs and exercises.
