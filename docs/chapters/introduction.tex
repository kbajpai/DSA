\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

The course is split up into 12 chapters. The bulk of the content is within chapters 1 - 10, each of which focuses on a data structure or algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{} Arrays and Strings
	\item{} Hashmaps and Sets
	\item{} Linked Lists
	\item{} Stacks and Queues
	\item{} Trees and Graphs
	\item{} Heaps
	\item{} Greedy Algorithms
	\item{} Binary Search
	\item{} Backtracking
	\item{} Dynamic Programming
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{These are the most important and most common data structures and algorithms for coding interviews.}

\textbf{Appendix A} contains several useful tools that can be used moving forward. There are code templates for all common patterns, cheatsheets regarding time and space complexities, and a flowchart that can be used as a general guideline when trying to figure out what data structure or algorithm should be used.

\textbf{Appendix B} contains few more techniques that aren't common/broad enough to warrant their own chapter.
